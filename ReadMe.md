The last codebase update includes the second part of the project, as described in Sprint 2 brief.  In addition, all CSS rules has been divided into relevant directories of the corresponding blocks/elements/modifiers. 

The project is the first one completed as a part of the Web Development '''Advanced HTML & CSS course'''.  This is a single page that contains different sections with diverse functions. In the code I used _display: flex_ (instead of ~~display: grid~~), _animations_, _different elements_ positions and embeded content, among other things.

__My plans of improving the project are:__
* enhancement of _:hover_ and _:visited_ effects using different colors, levels of opacity and shadows. 
* change the font the a smoother one.
